# PolyRun

> Execute code from various programming languages within other language environments, without converting code!

## Overview
PolyRun is a cross-language execution framework that allows developers to run code written in one programming language within another, without the hassle of code translation. PolyRun can seamlessly execute scripts in environments they were not originally designed for, making it a powerful tool for polyglot development.

## Features
- **Cross-Language Execution**: Run Python code in a Java environment, JavaScript in a C# program, and more.
- **No Conversion Needed**: No need to rewrite or transpile your code.
- **Polyglot-Friendly**: Ideal for teams and projects working with multiple languages.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add support for additional languages as plugins.

## Installation
